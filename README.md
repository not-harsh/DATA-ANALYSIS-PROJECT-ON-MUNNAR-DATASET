## Data analysis project on Munnar dataset

#Overview
This repository contains Python code for analyzing hotel data using the Pandas and Seaborn libraries. The dataset used for analysis is from Munnar, and the code covers various aspects of data processing, cleaning, visualization, and hypothesis testing.

#Contents
hotel_data_analysis.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for data analysis.
munnar.csv: Sample dataset used for the analysis.
Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
The code includes steps for cleaning and preprocessing the hotel data, such as handling missing values, converting data types, and creating new features.

#Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Explore the dataset through various visualizations using Seaborn. The EDA covers:

Distribution plots for numerical features.
Box plots and bar plots for understanding data composition.
Scatterplots to visualize relationships between variables.
3D plots for additional insights.
Business Analysis
The analysis includes addressing hypothetical business questions, such as:

Setting optimal prices for hotel properties.
Assessing customer ratings and their impact on pricing.
Analyzing the competitiveness of a specific hotel in terms of price and ratings.
Hypothesis Testing
Explore and test hypotheses related to hotel premium status based on ratings and pricing compared to the overall Munnar market.
